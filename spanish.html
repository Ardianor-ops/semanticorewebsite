  <h1 class="center">UMAP of Spanish Word Embeddings from FastText Clustered by HDBSCAN</h1>
  <p class="center_small"> To get a better understanding of the relationship between Noun Class and Lexical semantics in Spanish, <br>
    choose a cluster of nouns from the drop-down menu and use the tools on the side to zoom in on the dots <br>
    colored by their gender and hover over them to get their translations.
  </p>
  <p class="center_small"> <b>Note:</b>
    <u>The nouns were translated using Google Translate and therefore there are cases of mistranslation <br>
      The encoding and clustering of the word embeddings was completely separate from this process.</u>
